Similarly, other users will be able to view descriptions of your activity, communicate with you within our Services, and view your profile. </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>4. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?</h3>
    <p>
        <em>
            <strong>In Short:</strong> We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third parties that we may link to or who advertise on our Services, but are not affiliated with, our Services.
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Services may link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile applications and/or contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, services, or applications. Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications. The inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service, or application does not imply an endorsement by us. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the Services.

    <p>
        <em>
            <strong>In Short:</strong> If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider.

    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
    <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>


    <h3 id="infosafe">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em></p>
    <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>


    <h3 id="infominors">8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h3>
    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</em></p>
    <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age.

If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at mominraza.dev@gmail.com.</p>


    <h3 id="privacyrights">9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>

You can find their contact details here: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm </a>.

You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "<a href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>" below.

        processing grounds other than consent.
    </p>

    <h4>Account Information</h4>
    <p>
        If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you
        can:

        assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.
    </p>
    <p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at mominraza.dev@gmail.com.</p>


    <h3 id="DNT">10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ( "DNT" ) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>


    <h3 id="caresidents">11. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</em></p>
    <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year.
